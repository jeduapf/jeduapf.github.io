## Introduction

This project analyzes and optimizes the **daily electricity generation planning** using **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**. Developed by **José Eduardo Alves Pereira Filho**, this work studies different configurations of power plants (thermal and hydroelectric) to minimize production costs while meeting demand and reserve constraints.

The main goal is to determine the optimal number of power plants to activate and their generation levels at each period of the day, taking into account operating costs, startup costs, and operational constraints.

## Theoretical Background on Linear Optimization

**Linear Programming (LP)** aims to minimize (or maximize) a linear function subject to a set of linear constraints. In its standard form, a primal problem is written as:

$$
\min_{x} \; c^T x \quad \text{s.t.} \quad A x = b, \; x \ge 0
$$

Its associated **dual problem** is:

$$
\max_{y} \; b^T y \quad \text{s.t.} \quad A^T y \le c
$$

**Primal feasibility** means that there exists a vector $$x$$ satisfying $$A x = b$$ and $$x \ge 0$$, while **dual feasibility** requires a vector $$y$$ satisfying $$A^T y \le c$$.
When both problems admit feasible solutions, the **strong duality** theorem guarantees that their optimal values coincide:

$$
c^T x^* = b^T y^*
$$

This property forms the basis of much of the economic theory behind optimization: the Lagrange multipliers $$y_i$$ in the dual can be interpreted as **marginal costs** or **shadow prices**, representing the economic value of one additional unit of resource $$b_i$$.

In practice, the so-called **complementarity conditions** link the primal and dual optimal solutions:

$$
x_j (c_j - A_j^T y) = 0, \quad y_i (A_i x - b_i) = 0
$$

These relations show that:
- a strictly positive variable $$x_j$$ corresponds to a tight dual constraint,
- and a saturated primal constraint implies a nonzero dual multiplier.

Thus, analyzing both the primal and the dual helps not only to identify the optimal solution but also to understand the **system’s sensitivity** to variations in demand, costs, or generation capacities.

## Model Evolution

### Model 1.5: Base Model with Minimum Power

The first model includes the **minimum power constraint** for each active plant:

$$
\min \sum_{t=1}^{3} \sum_{p=1}^{5} P_{tp} \cdot C_{t} \cdot T_{p}
$$

Subject to:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{3} P_{tp} \geq D_{p}, \quad \forall p \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \quad (C1)
$$

$$
N_{tp} P^{\text{min}}_t \leq P_{tp} \leq N_{tp} P^{\text{max}}_t, \quad \forall t, p \quad (C2)
$$

$$
N_{tp} \leq Nb_t, \quad \forall t, p \quad (C3)
$$

where:
- $$P_{tp}$$: total power from type $$t$$ during period $$p$$
- $$N_{tp}$$: number of active plants of type $$t$$ during period $$p$$
- $$C_t$$: marginal cost (€/MWh)
- $$T_p$$: duration of period $$p$$
- $$D_p$$: demand during period $$p$$

**Result: Optimal cost = 869 k€**

```python
# Variables
N = {}  # Number of active plants (integer)
P = {}  # Produced power (continuous)

for t in PLANTS.keys():
    for p in HOURS.keys():
        N[f"{t},{p}"] = m.addVar(lb=0, name=f"N_{t},{p}", vtype=gp.GRB.INTEGER)
        P[f"{t},{p}"] = m.addVar(lb=0, name=f"P_{t},{p}", vtype=gp.GRB.CONTINUOUS)
```

### Model 2.1: Integration of Fixed Costs (Cbase)

The model evolves to include **fixed operating costs**:

$$
\min \sum_{t=1}^{3} \sum_{p=1}^{5} \left[(P_{tp} - N_{tp} \cdot P^{\text{min}}_t) \cdot C_{t}^{mwh} + N_{tp} \cdot C_{t}^{base}\right] \cdot T_{p}
$$

This formulation separates:
- the **variable cost** proportional to production above the minimum
- the **fixed cost** proportional to the number of active plants

**Result: Optimal cost = 979 k€** (+12.7% compared to model 1.5)

---

### Model 2.2: Adding Startup Costs (Cstart)

The introduction of the variable $$X_{tp}$$ (number of plants started) requires a new consistency constraint:

$$
N_{tp} \leq X_{tp} + N_{t(p-1)} \quad (C4)
$$

The objective function becomes:

$$
\min \sum_{t=1}^{3} \sum_{p=1}^{5} \left[(P_{tp} - N_{tp} \cdot P^{\text{min}}_t) \cdot C_{t}^{mwh} + N_{tp} \cdot C_{t}^{base}\right] \cdot T_{p} + \sum_{t=1}^{3} \sum_{p=1}^{5} X_{tp} \cdot C_{t}^{start}
$$

**Result: Optimal cost = 1014 k€** (+3.6% compared to model 2.1)

```python
# Startup constraint
for p in HOURS.keys():
    for t in PLANTS.keys():
        left_side = X[f"{t},{p}"] + Ntp(t, p, N, cyclic=False)
        right_side = N[f"{t},{p}"]
        m.addConstr(left_side >= right_side, name=f"start_{t}_{p}")
```

### Model 3.1: Reserve Constraint (15%)

To ensure **grid reliability**, a 15% reserve margin is enforced:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{3} (N_{tp} \cdot P^{\text{max}}_t - P_{tp}) \geq 0.15 \cdot D_{p} \quad (C5)
$$

**Result: Optimal cost = 1015 k€** (+0.1% compared to model 2.2)

---

### Model 4.1: Cyclic Planning

This model enforces that the final state (period 5) is consistent with the initial state (period 1):

$$
N_{tp} \leq X_{tp} + N_{t(p-1)} \quad \text{with } N_{t,0} = N_{t,5}
$$

This approach represents a **24-hour cyclic schedule**.

**Result: Optimal cost = 989 k€** (-2.6% compared to model 3.1)

---

### Model 5.1: Adding Hydroelectric Plants

Two hydroelectric plants are available:

| Type | Power (MW) | Base Cost (€/h) | Startup Cost (€) | Lowering (m/h) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| H1   | 900         | 90              | 1500             | 0.31           |
| H2   | 1400        | 150             | 1200             | 0.47           |

These plants **consume no fuel** (Cmwh = 0) but reduce the reservoir level.

**Result: Optimal cost = 890 k€** (-10.0% compared to model 4.1)

---

### Model 5.2: Pumping Constraint

The reservoir level must remain **constant over 24 hours**. Pumping requires 3000 MWh per meter of elevation:

$$
\sum_{p=1}^{5}\sum_{t=1}^{5} P_{tp} \cdot T_p \geq \sum_{p=1}^{5} D_{p} \cdot T_p + \sum_{p=1}^{5}\sum_{t=4}^{5} 3000 \cdot M_t \cdot N_{tp} \cdot T_p \quad (C6)
$$

where $$M_t$$ is the reservoir lowering speed (m/h).

**Result: Optimal cost = 987 k€** (+10.9% compared to model 5.1)

## Theoretical Analysis: Sensitivity and Duality

### Merit Order and Optimal Solution

The **Merit Order** method activates plants in ascending order of marginal cost.

For $$p=1$$ (demand = 15 GW): the numerical solution matches Gurobi results.

---

### Duality and Marginal Costs

The primal model in standard form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min & \quad 9 P_{A1} + 8.28 P_{B1} + 16.5 P_{C1} \\
\text{s.t.} & \quad P_{A1} + P_{B1} + P_{C1} = 15
\end{aligned}
$$

Its dual form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max & \quad 15 v \\
\text{s.t.} & \quad v \leq 9 \\
& \quad v \leq 8.28 \\
& \quad v \leq 16.5
\end{aligned}
$$

## Economic Interpretation

1. **Dominant fixed costs**: Moving from model 1.5 to 2.1 (+12.7%) highlights the significance of fixed costs.
2. **Moderate startup costs**: Model 2.2 adds only +3.6% extra cost.
3. **Cyclic planning advantage**: Model 4.1 reduces costs by 2.6% by optimizing transitions.
4. **Hydropower competitiveness**: Model 5.1 reduces costs by 10% thanks to zero variable cost.
5. **Pumping costs**: Model 5.2 shows reservoir neutrality adds +10.9% in cost.

## Mathematical Properties

### Total Unimodularity

The constraint matrix of model 1.5 exhibits **total unimodularity**:
- All coefficients belong to $$\{-1, 0, 1\}$$
- Each column contains at most two nonzero elements

**Consequence**: The continuous relaxation yields integer solutions, explaining the fast resolution (1 node explored).

### Complementarity Gaps

At the optimum, **Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT)** conditions are:

$$
(c_j - u^T A_j) x_j = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad u_i (a_i x - b_i) = 0
$$

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming** for solving complex energy planning problems. The progressive model analysis reveals:

- The importance of modeling **all cost components** (fixed, variable, startup)
- The benefit of **cyclic planning** for smoother transitions
- The economic interest of **hydropower**, despite pumping constraints
- Numerical stability due to the **unimodular structure** of the problem

Results obtained with **Gurobi** show very short computation times (<0.2s), this is due to the small size of the problem, in real life there are thousands of variables, here we just have hundreds.
