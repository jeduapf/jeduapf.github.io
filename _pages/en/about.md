Hi, I’m **José Eduardo**, a curious and motivated **Data Scientist** passionate about **energy systems** and their future.

This website is my space to share what I’m working on: ideas, projects, experiments, and things I’m learning. Some of these projects are not necessarily related to energy or data, and can simply be new things I want to explore, document, and keep track of. I’m always happy to connect, whether you have a question, a suggestion, or just want to chat.

I earned a **Double Engineering Degree** from **UNICAMP** and **École Centrale de Nantes**, where I dove deep into data analysis, signal and image processing, and received the **CREA SP 2022 Award** at **UNICAMP** for academic excellence.

More recently, I completed the **OSE Specialized Master’s** at **MINES PARIS PSL**, focusing on optimization, energy markets, financial modeling, and stochastic methods.
